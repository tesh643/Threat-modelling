# Threat-modelling

4 Scenarios were run covering: (1) AI Generated External phishing email utilising admin credentials, (2) Attack against Machine Processes and the data lake, (3) SQL Injection attack and (4) Insider attack taking Quant algorithms.

All scenarios were run against the cyber attack killchain, utilising the Mitre Att&ack framework and STRIDE for control gap assessments. Culminating in identified risks.

Controls Required
Regular security audits using ASVS specifically targeting the Solaris Health 360 application to detect vulnerabilities and weaknesses in its security measures.
Patch management to ensure the Solari Health 360 application and its underlying technologies are up-to-date and protected against known vulnerabilities.
Comprehensive employee training on phishing awareness to educate users of the Solaris Health 360 application about the risks of phishing attacks and how to identify and report suspicious emails.
Implementation of a Web Application Firewall (WAF) tailored to the Solari Health 360 application's traffic to monitor and filter incoming requests for malicious activity.
Deployment of Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) to enhance authentication security and prevent unauthorized access to the Solari Health 360 application.
Continuous network traffic monitoring to detect and respond to suspicious activity within the Solari Health 360 application's infrastructure.
Implementation of Role-based Access Control (RBAC) within the Solari Health 360 application to limit access to sensitive health data and functionalities based on user roles and permissions.
